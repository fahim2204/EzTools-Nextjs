              <p>
                Welcome to EZCalc. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. 
                This privacy policy will inform you as to how we look after your personal data when you visit our website 
                (regardless of where you visit it from) and tell you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

              <p>
                We do not collect any personal data directly. Our calculators run client-side in your browser, 
                meaning the data you input (like age, weight, or loan amount) stays on your device and is not sent to our servers.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">
                However, we may use third-party services like Google Analytics and Google AdSense which may collect:

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 ml-4">
                <li>Device information (browser type, OS)</li>
                <li>Usage data (pages visited, time spent)</li>
                <li>IP address</li>
                <li>Cookies for ad personalization and analytics</li>

                Our website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins, and applications. Clicking on those links 
                or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control
